# AGN-Host-Galaxies-SDSS

## 🔭 Project Summary
This project investigates the host galaxy properties of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR16). By comparing AGN-host galaxies with a control sample of non-AGN galaxies, we aim to explore differences in color, morphology, stellar mass, and redshift distribution.

This is part of a broader portfolio exploring supermassive black holes (SMBH), AGN feedback, and galaxy coevolution.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Extract and compare galaxy properties (e.g., color, magnitude, redshift) from SDSS for AGN and non-AGN samples
- Visualize trends in host properties using clean data plots
- Quantify statistical differences using simple metrics (e.g., KS test, median shift)
- Build a lightweight, reproducible, portfolio-worthy project with potential to scale into a publication

---

## 📚 Data Source
- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16
- Queried via `astroquery.sdss` and the CasJobs SQL interface

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 3
- `astroquery`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`
- Jupyter notebooks / modular scripts
