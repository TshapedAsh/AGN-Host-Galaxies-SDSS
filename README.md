# AGN-Host-Galaxies-SDSS
This project investigates the host galaxy properties of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR16). By comparing AGN-host galaxies with a control sample of non-AGN galaxies, we aim to explore differences in color, morphology, stellar mass, and redshift distribution.
